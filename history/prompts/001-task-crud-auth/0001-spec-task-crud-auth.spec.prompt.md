## Prompt

```
Task CRUD Operations with Authentication (Web Version) - Full-stack web application for managing personal tasks with user authentication, supporting create, read, update, delete operations with user data isolation.
```

## Response snapshot

Successfully created a comprehensive feature specification for Task CRUD Operations with Authentication. The specification includes:

1. Seven detailed user stories covering the complete user journey:
   - User Registration (P1)
   - User Login (P1)
   - View All My Tasks (P2)
   - Create New Task (P2)
   - Mark Task Complete/Incomplete (P3)
   - Update Task (P3)
   - Delete Task (P4)

2. Comprehensive functional requirements (43 total) covering:
   - Authentication (FR-001 to FR-011)
   - Task Management - Read (FR-012 to FR-016)
   - Task Management - Create (FR-017 to FR-022)
   - Task Management - Update (FR-023 to FR-027)
   - Task Management - Delete (FR-028 to FR-031)
   - Task Management - Completion Toggle (FR-032 to FR-035)
   - Security & Authorization (FR-036 to FR-040)
   - Error Handling (FR-041 to FR-043)

3. Two key entities defined:
   - User entity with UUID, email, hashed password, and timestamps
   - Task entity with auto-increment ID, user reference, title, description, completion status, and timestamps

4. Fourteen measurable success criteria with specific metrics:
   - Performance targets (sub-2s responses, 200ms API endpoints)
   - User experience metrics (sub-1min registration, sub-10s login)
   - Reliability targets (95% success rate, 99% error-free operations)
   - Security requirements (100% data isolation)

5. Comprehensive edge cases covering authentication, data validation, concurrency, network performance, and data integrity scenarios.

6. A quality checklist was created and validated, confirming the specification meets all requirements for planning phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete specification created for task management with authentication feature
- 🧪 Tests: No tests needed for specification creation
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements.md checklist in specs/001-task-crud-auth/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.plan to generate architecture plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification follows SDD principles with clear user value, testable requirements, and measurable outcomes

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All specification quality criteria met
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Run /sp.plan to generate architecture plan
