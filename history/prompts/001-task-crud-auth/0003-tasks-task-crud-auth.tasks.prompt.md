## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Story-Level Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Setup) → Phase 2 (Foundational)
                       ↓
                Phase 3 (US1: Registration)
                       ↓
                Phase 4 (US2: Login)
                       ↓
        ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐
        ↓                             ↓
Phase 5 (US3: View)          Phase 6 (US4: Create)
        ↓                             ↓
        ├─────────────┬───────────────┤
        ↓             ↓               ↓
   Phase 7 (US5)  Phase 8 (US6)  Phase 9 (US7)
   (Toggle)       (Update)        (Delete)
```

**Critical Path**: Setup → Foundational → US1 → US2 → (US3 OR US4) → remaining stories

**Parallelizable Stories** (after US2):
- US3 (View) and US4 (Create) are independent - can implement in parallel
- US5 (Toggle), US6 (Update), US7 (Delete) all depend on US3 or US4 existing tasks

### Task-Level Parallel Opportunities

**24 tasks marked [P]** can run in parallel within their phase:

- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: All 7 tasks (T009-T015) can run in parallel
- **US1 (Phase 3)**: T016, T018, T020 (schemas, pages, API client) can run in parallel before wiring (T017, T019, T021)
- **US2 (Phase 4)**: T022, T024-T026, T028 can run in parallel before wiring (T023, T027, T029)
- **US3 (Phase 5)**: T030, T033-T037 can run in parallel before wiring (T031-T032, T038)
- **US4 (Phase 6)**: T039, T042-T044 can run in parallel before wiring (T040-T041, T045)
- **US5 (Phase 7)**: T046, T049, T051 can run in parallel before wiring (T047-T048, T050)
- **US6 (Phase 8)**: T052, T055-T057 can run in parallel before wiring (T053-T054, T058)
- **US7 (Phase 9)**: T061-T062 can run in parallel before wiring (T059-T060, T063-T064)
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Most tasks (T065-T074, T076-T077) can run in parallel, except T075 (migration) and T078 (E2E test)

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope (Recommended First Deliverable)

**MVP = Phase 1-4 (Setup + Foundational + US1 + US2)**

This delivers a working authentication system where users can:
- Register accounts
- Log in with credentials
- Receive JWT tokens
- Access protected routes

**Value**: Complete authentication foundation enables all subsequent features. Independently testable and deployable.

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Milestone 1** (MVP): Phases 1-4 → Authentication working end-to-end
2. **Milestone 2**: Add Phase 5 (View) OR Phase 6 (Create) → First task management feature
3. **Milestone 3**: Add remaining Phase (Create OR View) → Complete core CRUD read/create
4. **Milestone 4**: Add Phases 7-9 (Toggle, Update, Delete) → Full CRUD operations
5. **Milestone 5**: Phase 10 (Polish) → Production-ready

### Independent Testing Per Story

Each user story phase includes acceptance scenarios that can be tested independently:

- **US1**: Test registration flow without login existing
- **US2**: Test login with manually created user (or after US1)
- **US3**: Test view with seed data (or after US4 creates tasks)
- **US4**: Test create and verify in database
- **US5**: Test toggle on created/seed tasks
- **US6**: Test update on created/seed tasks
- **US7**: Test delete on created/seed tasks

---

## Task Format Validation

✅ **All tasks follow required checklist format**:
- Checkbox: `- [ ]`
- Task ID: Sequential (T001-T078)
- [P] marker: 24 tasks marked parallelizable
- [Story] label: All user story tasks labeled (US1-US7)
- Description: Clear action with file path

✅ **Organization**: Tasks organized by user story for independent implementation

✅ **Completeness**: Each user story has all required components (schemas, endpoints, pages, components, API client, wiring)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review tasks.md** with team to confirm scope and priorities
2. **Execute MVP** (Phases 1-4) to establish authentication foundation
3. **Iterate on user stories** (Phases 5-9) in priority order
4. **Polish for production** (Phase 10) before deployment
5. **Run E2E tests** (T078) to validate complete user flows

**Ready for `/sp.implement`** to begin task execution in order.vv
```
