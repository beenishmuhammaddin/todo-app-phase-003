## Prompt

Now start implementing phase 1

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed Phase 1: Setup & Infrastructure for the Task CRUD Operations with Authentication feature. All 8 setup tasks have been completed:

1. **Project Structure** (T001): Created monorepo directory structure with frontend/, backend/, specs/, and history/ directories
2. **Frontend Initialization** (T002): Initialized frontend with Next.js 16+ App Router in frontend/ directory, including all necessary configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, next.config.ts, tailwind.config.ts, etc.)
3. **Backend Initialization** (T003): Initialized backend with FastAPI and UV in backend/ directory, including pyproject.toml with dependencies and src/main.py entry point
4. **Docker Configuration** (T004): Created docker-compose.yml with 3 services (db, backend, frontend) with proper configuration for development
5. **Git Ignore** (T005): Created root .gitignore with proper exclusions for node_modules, .env, __pycache__, .next, and other development artifacts
6. **Documentation** (T006): Created comprehensive README.md with project overview, tech stack, quick start instructions, and architecture details
7. **Agent Instructions** (T007): Created root CLAUDE.md with Phase II agent instructions and constitutional requirements
8. **Workspace Instructions** (T008): Created workspace-specific CLAUDE.md files in frontend/ and backend/ with context-specific guidelines

All tasks in Phase 1 have been marked as completed in the tasks.md file. The project foundation is now in place with proper directory structure, configuration files, and initial setup for both frontend and backend components.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete Phase 1 setup with 8/8 tasks completed, establishing foundation for subsequent phases
- 🧪 Tests: No tests needed for setup phase
- 📁 Files: Created 16+ files across frontend, backend, and root directories with proper configuration
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with Phase 2: Foundational Infrastructure (database models, security utilities)
- 🧠 Reflection: Phase 1 establishes the monorepo structure and development environment following constitutional requirements

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All Phase 1 tasks completed successfully
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to Phase 2 implementation
